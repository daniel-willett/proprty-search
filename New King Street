My Thoughts:
Reminds me of when I was living in Camden Crescent.
I don't really like the area this property is in (can see shady people hanging about and can smell drugs)
Small fridge is really dire
We haven't even seen the other properties and need to consider making an offer for tomorrow and there's a couple who are probably going to put and offer in
Likely this property isn't for me

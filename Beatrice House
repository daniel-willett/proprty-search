2nd Floor - No Elevator so only stairs
Rent is just Rent. Doesn't cover anything else
Unfurnished so only the following available:
 + Oven
 + Hobs - Electric
 + Sizable Friday (like The Willows)
 + Sink
 + Some blinds and cupboard left behind

Decent sized Bathroom
Bath with 2 nozzles: Shower head and bath head
 + Was told the shower is "powerful"

Fairly warm despite no heating having been put on
 + Energy Performance B 
1 cupboard for hanging clothes
 + No space to lay clothes down on

Bedroom has no bed although I could see the outline of where a bed once was
 + Big enough to hold my keyboard

Washer dryer
A screen and phone to see who is buzzing the apartment
Council Tax band B
Communal garden
Bins are in shed outside
Post is outside boxes


Electric is set to Octopus for now
I have to organise wifi
No gas
Water is only Wessex Water

Main dining area is 3.75m x 4.50m

Overall thoughts:
This place seems nice and reminds me of a slightly smaller version of The Willows
Being unfurnished is daunting but I try and remember that Dad told me not to worry
Should be a good contender on our list

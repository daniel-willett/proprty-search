A few rooms were shown to me. They basically had the same layout except one was larger dining room than the other (and possible bedroom as well).
Showroom:
Dining area was 4.40m x 3.90m
£1495 room:
Dining area was 3.93m x 3.70m

This property was freshly built. First person to live in the whole building moves in tomorrow.

In the showroom there was 170cm of space between the 3seater sofa and the kitchen edge which was along the length (longer side) of the dining area
The reduction in size is 4.40-3.93 = 0.47m so the space for a desk is 170cm-47cm = 123cm (for reference my current desk in Englishcombe is 104cm and just about holds my laptop+monitor)

1st month rent can be free????
This seems like a too good to be true scenario and I really tried asking the estate agent to confirm what she meant but no matter how many times I framed the question it always came to the answer that they were willing to just not let me pay the first month's rent.

Overall thoughts:
This is a strong contender and should be considered a serious place to stay. I am weary of there only being 3 slots left so probably want to make a decision on this ASAP
